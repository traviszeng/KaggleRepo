To gain access to this competition's dataset on BigQuery, you must:
1. Join the open google group provisioned for access to the private dataset. First follow this link: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/bigquery-geotab
2. Log in with a Google account.
3. Click on `Join group` in the pop-up that appears.
4. You will now have access to query the dataset `kaggle-competition-datasets.geotab_intersection_congestion.train`. NOTE: This is NOT an email distribution list. So once you see `You cannot view topics in this forum` after joining the group, you do not need to take any further action and can proceed to access the dataset.
5. You can now access [the dataset](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/kaggle-competition-datasets:geotab_intersection_congestion) and run your own copy of [the starter kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/sirtorry/bigquery-ml-template-intersection-congestion/)
